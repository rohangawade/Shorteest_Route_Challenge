Finding shortest route to cover all the kiosk centers of the company for the two drivers
<ul>
<li>
Used greedy approach to find the shortest route.
<li>Implemented the 2 opt swap algorithm so find the optimal route which is better than greedy approach result. Used route determined by 
the greedy algorithm as an input to 2opt function.
<li> Visualized the route on maps using folium package. Displayed inline in the jupyter notebook and also created .html file for the same
<li><b>Technology : </b> Python, pandas, numpy, folium, Jupyter notebook
